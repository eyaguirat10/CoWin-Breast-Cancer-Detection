        "## **Problem Statement**\n",
        "\n",
        "Breast cancer is one of the most common and life-threatening diseases affecting women worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, it accounts for a significant proportion of cancer-related deaths among women, with **approximately 2.3 million new cases diagnosed each year**. While the highest incidence is usually observed in women aged **40 to 70**, younger women are increasingly being diagnosed, highlighting the need for vigilance across all age groups. Men can also develop breast cancer, though it is much rarer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Early detection of breast cancer is crucial because survival rates are significantly higher when the disease is identified at an initial stage. However, **late diagnosis remains common**, particularly in regions with limited access to screening programs, diagnostic facilities, or trained specialists. Factors contributing to delayed detection include:\n",
        "- Socio-economic barriers  \n",
        "- Lack of awareness about breast health  \n",
        "- Cultural stigmas  \n",
        "- Shortages of radiologists or screening centers  \n",
        "\n",
        "In some areas, women may delay seeking care due to fear, misinformation, or limited healthcare infrastructure — leading to advanced diagnoses when treatment is more difficult and costly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Breast cancer can manifest in different forms : **ductal carcinoma, lobular carcinoma, and other subtypes** each with distinct characteristics and progression rates. The disease may present **asymptomatically** in its early stages, which is why imaging techniques such as **mammography** are critical for screening. Even with mammograms, subtle signs like **microcalcifications** or small lesions can be easily overlooked, even by experienced radiologists.\n",
        "\n",
        "This issue is particularly pressing in regions where incidence is high and **medical resources are limited**, such as parts of **North Africa**, the **Middle East**, and **some areas of the United States**, where datasets like **CBIS-DDSM** and **MIAS** have been collected. These datasets demonstrate the variability in breast tissue density and lesion appearance, increasing the challenge of accurate detection.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Stakeholders Affected\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Doctors / Radiologists**: Responsible for interpreting mammograms and providing medical decisions. Face diagnostic complexity, heavy workloads, and pressure to avoid errors.\n",
        "- **Hospitals and Clinics**: Handle screening, treatment, and patient management. Diagnostic support tools can improve outcomes and reduce costs.\n",
        "- **Public Health Organizations**: Lead screening campaigns and healthcare policy. Better tools improve allocation of resources and reduce mortality.\n",
        "- **Researchers**: Use datasets and AI models to develop new diagnostic tools and improve early detection performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Given these challenges, there is a **critical need for computer-assisted systems** that help healthcare professionals detect breast cancer early, accurately, and efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "Such systems can:\n",
        "- Generate **predictions** and **personalized recommendations** based on mammography or clinical data  \n",
        "- Improve clinical **decision-making** while minimizing risk to patients  \n",
        "- Ensure **role-based access** to data: doctors get detailed results, patients receive **validated, understandable recommendations**  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, breast cancer is a complex issue involving **medical, social, and economic factors**. Our project integrates **artificial intelligence** into the diagnostic workflow to:\n",
        "- **Enhance early detection**\n",
        "- **Reduce late diagnoses**\n",
        "- **Provide safe, actionable guidance for patients**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ultimately, the project aims to assist all stakeholders and improve breast cancer management outcomes.\n",
